# Silkware-SilksongCheat
A Hollow Knight Silksong Cheat Menu

I recommend downloading the latest release from the release tab. 
It is the Silkware.exe it avoids any issues with needing specific python libraries.

- "Silkware V3" on the right under the "Releases" tab
- launch the game and charge the save
- alt+tab, launch the silkware.exe, check the box, then let the panel open and alt-tab back to the game (i closed it the first time and the godmod was working, but it stoped briefly after ; no problem by keeping the panel on the bottom of my sceen)
